    "Let's break down what's happening here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We set up our dcc.Input in the usual way, except that we assigned an id to it, and added another Div after it with an assigned id ('my-id' and 'my-div' respectively)\n",
    "2. app.callback is called as a decorator function over update_output_div. The \"inputs\" and \"outputs\" of our application interface are described declaratively through the app.callback decorator.\n",
    "    For more on Python decorators visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics#Decorators \n",
    "3. Inside @app.callback, Output and Input are abbreviated forms of dash.dependencies.Output and dash.dependencies.Input. Note how we imported them from dash.dependencies by name.\n",
    "4. In Dash, the inputs and outputs of our application are simply the properties of a particular component. \n",
    "    In this example, our input is the \"value\" property of the component that has the ID \"my-id\". \n",
    "    Our output is the \"children\" property of the component with the ID \"my-div\".\n",
    "5. Whenever an input property changes, the function that the callback decorator wraps will get called automatically. Dash provides the function with the new value of the input property as an input argument and Dash updates the property of the output component with whatever was returned by the function.\n",
    "6. The component_id and component_property keywords inside Output and Input are optional (there are only two arguments for each of those objects). We included them here for clarity but we’ll omit them from here on out for brevity and readability.\n",
    "7. Don't confuse the dash.dependencies.Input object inside app.callback from the dash_core_components.Input object inside app.layout. The former is just used in these callbacks and the latter is an actual component.\n",
    "8. Notice how we don't set a value for the children property of the my-div component in the layout. When the Dash app starts, it automatically calls all of the callbacks with the initial values of the input components in order to populate the initial state of the output components. In this example, if you specified something like html.Div(id='my-div', children='Hello world'), it would get overwritten when the app starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's sort of like programming with Microsoft Excel: whenever an input cell changes, all of the cells that depend on that cell will get updated automatically. This is called \"Reactive Programming\".\n",
    "Remember how every component was described entirely through its set of keyword arguments? Those properties are important now. With Dash interactivity, we can dynamically update any of those properties through a callback function. Frequently we'll update the children of an html component to display new text or the figure of a dcc.Graph component to display new data, but we could also update the style of a component or even the available options of a dcc.Dropdown component!\n"
